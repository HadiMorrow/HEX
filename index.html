						<p>HEX did 6.33x price in the last 30 days!
							Over $1.5 Billion dollars of Bitcoin has claimed their free HEX. 168K+ BTC across 24K+ addresses. ~78% of HEX is staked across 96K+ stakes, mostly 635 days or longer. Over 66K ETH has joined the transformation lobby to be transformed
							directly into HEX. Transform ETH directly into HEX using <a href="https://go.hex.win/?r=0x836Abde9b9Da89F70c1501A506c4cba5638C30A4">this 10% bonus link</a> or use the BEST exchange: HEX exchange. Both are signup-free and secure, executing
							peer-to-peer on the blockchain. No counterparty risk!</p>

						<p>Bitcoin went up 26x from $750 to $20,000 in only 378 days. Ethereum went up 233x from $6 to $1,400 in 403 days. If you got in at $1 you made 7 times more. Imagine how 1,400x returns feel. Some people got in 3 times cheaper than that!
							Had
							you put in $223 when you first could, it would have gone up 4,500x to $1 Million, in only 3.5 years. Life changing. Most of the wealth in the world is made by those that get in first!</p>

						<h1 class="h1top" alt="HEX IS THE FIRST HIGH INTEREST BLOCKCHAIN CD">HEX IS THE FIRST HIGH INTEREST BLOCKCHAIN CD</h1>

						<p>CDs, known as Certificates of Deposit or Time Deposits, are worth Trillions of dollars. CDs are worth more than gold, credit card companies, and cash. CDs pay higher interest than savings accounts, requiring money be deposited for a
							fixed time. Banks profit on poor customer service, early withdrawal fees, and auto-renewing you at worse rates. The % they pay you in interest doesn't keep up with the % prices increase. New USD is printed all the time, making yours
							less
							valuable. HEX replaces inefficient currencies, banks and payment networks with verifiably secure peer-to-peer technology. HEX takes the profit out of banks and government money printing and gives it to HEX holders.</p>

						<h1 class="h1top" alt="HEX IS DESIGNED TO GO HIGHER, FASTER, AND RETAIN ITS VALUE.">HEX IS DESIGNED TO GO HIGHER, FASTER, AND RETAIN ITS VALUE.</h1>

						<p>How? Use a computer science breakthrough to disrupt the largest markets in the world with a product of nearly infinite profit margin. Eliminate middlemen, users can transform Ethereum directly into HEX. Kick-start adoption, give
							Bitcoiners free HEX. Help small guys, penalize Bitcoin whales. Early claimers get bonuses, late claimers get penalties. Pay bonuses to referrers and those referred. Pay the unclaimed coins and interest to those who time lock their HEX.
							Longer and larger stakes get more shares and the price per share only increases. HEX aligns incentives, so the more people that participate, the better everyone does!</p>

						<h2>Buy Ethereum to transform it into HEX, claim for free if you have Bitcoin, or buy from someone who did! Stake HEX early, long and large, and watch it multiply!</h2>
